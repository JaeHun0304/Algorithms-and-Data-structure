# Algorithms-and-Data-structure

Hi, this repositary is created for studying algorithms and data structure in C++ language.
The idea and implementation of the algorithms and data stuructures are come from sources like https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ 
and https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms.
I am going to use this repositary for learning purposes, and license under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 for the khan academy algorithm materials.

## Algorithms
Implementation of various concepts like recursion, dynamic programming, and other algorithms to solve various problems efficiently. Bascially, this folder stores codes to find out how to implement various algorithms in practice

## data_strucutre
Various implementation of data structrues like linked list, tree, dynamic array, and hash functions to explore the characteristics like strength and weakness when they are integrated with the different algorithms.

## STL
Practice codes to learn various C++ STL(Standard Template Library) containers and their algoritms. The practice codes implement various exmaples for iterating data containers with iterator smart pointer and apply algorithms to modify the data in those containers. Details of header files like <vector>, <set>, <map>, <deque>, <algorithms>, and <iterator> are studied.
