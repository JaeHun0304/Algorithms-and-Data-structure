# Algorithms-and-Data-structure

Hi, this repositary is created for studying algorithms and data structure in C++ language.
The idea and implementation of the algorithms and data stuructures are come from sources like https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ 
and https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms.
I am going to use this repositary for learning purposes, and license under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 for the khan academy algorithm materials.
